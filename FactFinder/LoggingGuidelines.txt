Here are some guidelines for how and what to log (using log4net):

Which logger names should I use?
================================

Every class that needs logging gets its own logger. Use the overload of 
LogManager.GetLogger() that takes a System.Type argument and call it with
typeof(YourClassNameHere). This will automatically create logger names like
"Fully.Qualified.Path.To.YourClassNameHere". The advantage is that any
application using the library can configure a logger named "Fully.Qualified",
say, to set logging options for all classes within that namespace.

To make this easiest, all classes that need logging have a private static
logger that gets initialised inside the static constructor:

private static ILog log;

static YourClassNameHere()
{
    log = LogManager.GetLogger(typeof(YourClassNameHere));
}

Which logging level should I use?
=================================

The library tries to adhere to the following rules:

FATAL - Something very critical went wrong and the library cannot function
        at all. For instance, log a FATAL message if FACT-Finder is
        completely unreachable.
ERROR - This indicates a problem that has only a local effect. For instance,
        if a certain feature is not supported by the FACT-Finder version in
        use, an ERROR can be logged and an empty result returned - but
        execution of the library can continue otherwise.
WARN  - These should be used, when the programmer anticipates that the
        user has misused the library, without actually running into errors.
        For instance, deprecation information can be logged at WARN level.
        Non-critically inconsistent parameters are also a candidate for this.
INFO  - Log messages at this level are used to trace very coarse-grained
        control flow. Logging at this level should allow the user to see
        when the library is active and what it does, but the messages should
        not clutter up a production log too much. For instance, requests to 
        the FACT-Finder server should be logged at INFO level.
DEBUG - This is for all logging messages that are too fine-grained to be
        logged in a production environment. Any information that is deemed
        useful for development by a programmer can be logged at DEBUG level.
